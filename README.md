In this project, I utilized parameters like Region, Country, Sales Reps, and demographic details (Name, Gender, Age) to analyze performance trends. The data also included Rank Levels, Products, Years, Quarters, and Months to track time-based sales performance. Revenue (USD) served as the key metric to measure financial outcomes. The dashboard provides insights into regional performance, individual contributions, and product-level trends for better financial planning and strategy.
